    <h1 style="font-weight:700">What Are Researchers Doing About Insomnia?</h1>
    <p><b>By Adi,</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 min read</p>
    <br />
    <code>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a dissatisfaction with falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. Insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). There isn’t a universally accepted model for this disorder due to there being a large variety of causes. Nevertheless, researchers are working on a model that can account for the diversity of symptoms and causes and find the best treatment.</code><br /><br />

        such nights of insomnia. <br>

        Tip-toe, hushed footsteps<br>

    The lack of sleep can mean patients can't dream as
    much, a human experience they miss out on. The closing lines suggest that researching insomnia is very important to
    find a solution to end their misery.

    <br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Do you think you suffer from insomnia?</h2>
    <p>
      According to Levenson, Kay, & Buysse (2015), prevalence rates of insomnia disorder are between 5% to 15% of
      people worldwide. It is the second-most common mental disorder. Doctors typically diagnose this by asking, <b>“Do
        you experience
        difficulty
        sleeping?”</b> or <b>“Do you have difficulty staying asleep?”</b> These questions on insomnia are a way to clue
      into what
      underlying cause may be at play.

      Other objective measures like <b><a href="html/tools.html">actigraphy or polysomnography</a></b> are not (yet)
      part of
      most routine diagnoses. Here is the <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/insomnia-symptoms#types">DSM-5-TR
        checklist by Psych Central</a>
      diagnoses. Depending on how long the disorder is affecting you, insomnia falls under two types. The most common
      type is acute insomnia (1 night to a few weeks), which is
      short-term and can be caused by stress. Chronic insomnia (3 nights a week for 3 months or more) is long-term and
      can be caused by a variety of factors.

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Hyperarousal</h2>
    <p>
      Levenson Hyperarousal tends to be a common overarching symptom. It is theorized that a state of hypervigilance
      during the
      day
      can lead to difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep at night. This state is measured by “cortisol, heart rate
      variability, <b><a href="html/EEG.html">EEG</a></b>, or even self-report.” (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015)

      A common scenario is:

      “Once an individual begins to experience sleep difficulties, worry and rumination shift from life events to
      worries
      about sleep itself and about the daytime consequences of not getting enough sleep. This negatively-toned cognitive
      activity is further fueled if a sleep-related threat is detected or a sleep deficit is perceived.” (Roth T., 2007)

      A way to prevent this is to calm your mind and do less mind-intensive tasks like folding clothes before sleep. If
      you realize you are not falling asleep, get up for 10-15 minutes, do some stretches, and get your mind off the
      stressor.

    <p>This picture explains the different levels of arousal and their potential effects. Know that
      the sympathetic response which can prevent sleep is caused by a stressor.</p>


    <br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Could it be genetic?</h2>
    <p>
      Early studies were done on flies to find potential genes responsible for insomnia. It is estimated, based on
      human studies, that the disorder is 31% to 58% heritable (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015). If someone in your
      family has insomnia, you may also be predisposed to having the disorder.
      “Predisposing” factors come from the areas of (epi-)genetics and early life stress that contribute to individual
      differences at the level of brain function and personality. (Riemann et al., 2022) It is also approximated that 8%
      of patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia are suffering from a less common delayed sleep phase syndrome
      (DSPS), a circadian rhythm disorder. <a
        href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_kwartler_what_causes_insomnia?language=en">(Dan Kwartler, 2018)</a> This
      would make your sleeping schedule different from the typical 24 and therefore sleep only seems inconsistent. It is
      important to talk to your doctor if this is the case, as this requires a different treatment plan.
    </p><br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">What molecules are involved?</h2>
    <p>
      While the studies go into more nuances, we can group these molecules as ones that make you sleepy and ones that
      keep you awake.

      Keep your sleep: γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA], adenosine, serotonin, melatonin, prostaglandin D2
      (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015)
      Keep you awake: catecholamines, orexin, and histamine

      It isn’t as simple as taking pills for sleepiness hormones, as the body needs to create a balance to function.
      This depiction of hormones is also a vast oversimplification. Some studies show some promise with taking
      melatonin. However, there are some side effects, and more research needs to be conducted to see if this has uses
      beyond those with serious medical complications. (Besag, 2019)

    <p>This is taken from a research paper about adenosine's effect on sleep-homeostatic processes. While the nuances of
      the paper are beyond the scope of this blog a big point of this graph is to show that molecules can have a
      function of causing the feeling of sleepiness. They regulate each other and cyclically interact with each other
      rising and falling throughout the days.</p>

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Current Solutions</h2>
    <p>
    <p>

      Insomnia can be treated through evidence-based methods, which encompass medication (such as hypnotic drugs) and
      non-pharmacological techniques, collectively known as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).
      <br /><br />The five primary components of CBT-I are: (Reichert, C., et al., 2016)<br />

      <li>Sleep hygiene involves guidelines for managing sleep, including what to do and what to avoid</li>
      <li>Sleep restriction, where sleep duration is intentionally limited to increase appropriate nighttime
        sleepiness.</li>
      <li>Stimulus control, aimed at reducing the time spent awake in bed.</li>
      <li> Cognitive therapy, which focuses on managing thoughts before bedtime.</li>
      <li>Relaxation techniques to promote physical relaxation.</li>
