        <h2 style="font-weight:700">What is the sleep cycle (EEGs)</h2>
        <p>
            EEG, or electroencephalography, is a crucial measurement technique in the study of sleep patterns and brain
            activity during different sleep stages. It involves placing electrodes on the scalp to record electrical
            brain
            activity. Sleep is a complex process with distinct stages, including REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM
            phases, each associated with specific EEG patterns. As an individual transitions from wakefulness to sleep,
            their brain exhibits alpha and theta waves, indicating relaxation and drowsiness. Deeper sleep stages are
            characterized by slower delta waves. Conversely, REM sleep, where vivid dreaming occurs, displays beta-like
            brainwave patterns resembling wakefulness. When a patient with insomnia seeks evaluation, EEG can reveal
            irregularities in sleep architecture, aiding in diagnosis and the development of tailored treatment
            strategies.
            It helps uncover the intricate interplay of sleep stages in memory consolidation, emotional processing, and
            cognitive restoration, contributing to a deeper understanding of the role of sleep in maintaining overall
            well-being.

        <p>This table shows how in different stages of the sleep the electrical activity of brain changes. It typically
            follows a somewhat regular pattern of going up and down in levels of sleep. Stage 4 is when you are least
            likely going to awake and stage one is when you are closest. REM sleep is strange in that it looks in terms
            of electrical activity that you are awake, however this isn't the case as your body is paralyzed and you are
            dreaming.</p>
