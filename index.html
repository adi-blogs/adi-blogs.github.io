    <h1 style="font-weight:700">What Are Reasearchers Doing About Insomnia?</h1> <b>By Adi</b>
    <br /><br />
    <code>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by dissatisfaction with falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. Insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). There isn’t a universally accepted model for this disorder due to there being a large variety of causes. Nevertheless, researchers are working on a model that can account for the diversity of symptoms and causes and find the best treatment.</code><br /><br />

        such nights of insomnia. <br>
        such yearned dreams.<br>
        all that's been longed for<br>
        all that's gone long before.<br>
        Tip-toe, hushed footsteps<br>
        to sink into dreams.<br>
        <br>
        Open me up<br>
        and check what it means.

    This poem expressses what patients with insomnia go through. The lack of sleep can mean patients can't dream as
    much, a human experience they miss out on. The closing lines suggest that researching insomnia is very important to
    them. They want to uncover and understand why they are going through restless nights, which can contribute to
    improved mental well-being.

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Do you think you suffer from insomnia?</h2>
    <p>
      According to Levenson, Kay, & Buysse (2015), prevalence rates of insomnia disorder are between 5% to 15% of
      people worldwide. It is the second-most common mental disorder. Doctors typically diagnosis this by asking, <b>“Do
        you experience
        difficulty
        sleeping?”</b> or <b>“Do you have difficulty staying asleep?”</b> These questions on insomnia are a way to clue
      into what
      underlying cause may be at play. Other objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of
      most routine diagnoses. Here is the <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/insomnia-symptoms#types">DSM-5-TR
        checklist by Psych Central</a>
      diagnoses.

    <br /><br />
    <br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Hyperarousal</h2>
    <p>
      Hyperarousal tends to be a common overarching symptom. It is theorized that a state of hypervigilance during the
      day
      can lead to difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep at night. This state is measured by “cortisol, heart rate
      variability, <a href="html/EEG.html">EEG</a>, or even self-report.” (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015)

      A common scenario is:

      “Once an individual begins to experience sleep difficulties, worry and rumination shift from life events to
      worries
      about sleep itself and about the daytime consequences of not getting enough sleep. This negatively-toned cognitive
      activity is further fueled if a sleep-related threat is detected or a sleep deficit is perceived.” (Roth T., 2007)

      A way to prevent this is to calm your mind and do less mind-intensive tasks like folding clothes before sleep. If
      you realize you are not falling asleep, get up for 10-15 minutes, do some stretches, and get your mind off the
      stressor.

    <br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Could it be genetic?</h2>
    <p>
      Early studies were done on flies to find potential genes responsible for insomnia. It is estimated, based on
      human studies, that the disorder is 31% to 58% heritable (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015). If someone in your
      family has insomnia, you may also be predisposed to having the disorder.
      “Predisposing” factors come from the areas of (epi-)genetics and early life stress that contribute to individual
      differences at the level of brain function and personality. (Riemann et al., 2022)
    </p><br /><br />

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">What molecules are involved</h2>
    <p>
      While the studies go into more nuances, we can group these molecules as ones that make you sleepy and ones that
      keep you awake.

      Keep your sleep: γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA], adenosine, serotonin, melatonin, prostaglandin D2
      (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse, 2015)
      Keep you awake: catecholamines, orexin, and histamine

      It isn’t as simple as taking pills for sleepiness hormones, as the body needs to create a balance to function.
      This depiction of hormones is also a vast oversimplification. Some studies show some promise with taking
      melatonin. However, there are some side effects, and more research needs to be conducted to see if this has uses
      beyond those with serious medical complications. (Besag, 2019)

    <h2 style="font-weight:700">Models and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Stimulus Control Model</b>
      <!-- "In 1972, Bootzin112 proposed that stimuli associated with sleep (e.g., a quiet, dark bedroom) become
      discriminative stimuli that reinforce sleep."<br /> <br /> -->
      <b>Solution:</b> Try to sleep in the same dark and quiet room
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Cognitive Model</b>
      <!-- "The cognitive model of insomnia25 proposes that individuals with insomnia are susceptible to excessive worry
      and
      unpleasant intrusive thoughts, particularly those related to getting enough sleep and the consequences of sleep
      disturbance. This worry may develop into sleep-related anxiety, lead to increased vigilance for sleep-related
      threats (e.g., watching the clock at night), and ultimately result in an exaggeration of the magnitude of the
      actual sleep disruption. Cognitive therapy for insomnia challenges these maladaptive cognitive processes and
      limits the behaviors that maintain unhelpful beliefs and insomnia.113"-->
      <br /> <br />
      <b>Solution:</b> It is okay to realize that your intrusive thoughts are causing you to be awake. Get up, do some
      stretching, and go back to sleep a few minutes later.
