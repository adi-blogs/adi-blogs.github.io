    <br /><br />
    <code>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It's characterized by dissatifcation in 
      falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. Insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term), and it can
      have a variety of causes.</code><br /><br />

    <h2>Prevalence</h2>
    <p>According to Levenson, Kay, & Buysse (2015), prevalence rates of insomnia disorder is set between at 5% to 15% of
      people worldwide. It is the second-most common mental disorder. This is often diagnosed by questioning “Do you
      experience difficulty sleeping?” or “Do you have
      difficulty staying asleep?” These questions on insomina can be seen as a way to clue into what underlying cause
      may be at play. Other objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine
      diagnoses.

    <h2>Hyperarousal</h2>
    state of hypervigilance during the day and difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep at night

    <h2>Could it be genetic?</h2>
    <p>Talking about the heritability of sleep wake cycles. Studies done on flies and twins (Levenson, Kay, & Buysse,
      2015)</p>

    <h2>What molecules are involved</h2>
    <p>γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA], adenosine, serotonin, melatonin, prostaglandin D2</p>

    <h2>Models and Solutions</h2>
    <p></p>
    Perpetuating Factors
    The “3P model,”110 a diathesis-stress model, describes a set of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating
    factors that may contribute to the development and maintenance of insomnia. Predisposing factors, such as age or
    sex, make an individual more susceptible to insomnia, and precipitating factors are events that coincide with the
    onset of insomnia, such as major stressors. <br />

    <b>Increasing time in bed to “catch up” on sleep doesn't work if it isn't consistent. </b><br /><br />

    Stimulus Control<br />
    "In 1972, Bootzin112 proposed that stimuli associated with sleep (eg, a quiet, dark bedroom) become discriminative
    stimuli that reinforce sleep."<br />

    <b>Try to sleep in the same dark and quiet room</b><br /><br />

    Cognitive Model<br />
    "The cognitive model of insomnia25 proposes that individuals with insomnia are susceptible to excessive worry and
    unpleasant intrusive thoughts, particularly those related to getting enough sleep and the consequences of sleep
    disturbance. This worry may develop into sleep-related anxiety, lead to increased vigilance for sleep-related
    threats (eg, watching the clock at night), and ultimately result in an exaggeration of the magnitude of the actual
    sleep disruption. Cognitive therapy for insomnia challenges these maladaptive cognitive processes and limits the
    behaviors that maintain unhelpful beliefs and insomnia.113"<br />
